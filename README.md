# The challenge was from Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I used HTML, SCSS and the logic of 7.1 architecture for SCSS files, BEM, JS for mobile navigation toggle.
